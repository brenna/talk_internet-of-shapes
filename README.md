# The Internet Of Shapes

## Talk Description
HTML5 and CSS3 have opened up a wealth of design possibilities in our code. Starting from the humble CSS triangle, this talk will explore various techniques for implementing geometric designs with pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Crafting shapes in code makes for flexible, easy to maintain websites and will give you a taste of some of the coolest emerging front-end techniques, like CSS transforms, SVG and Canvas.
